\section{Conclusions}
The mechanical response of additively manufactured Ti-5553 octet truss lattice structures was investigated. The material responded anisotropically to compressive load due to residual stresses that were present from the build process. This was apparent in both HEXRD testing and confirmed by an FEA model.  The primary direction of loading during compressive is down the strut direction, with some locations demonstrating off-axis loading. The failure mechanism of the sample was plastic yielding first, followed by elastic buckling, as predicted by the DFA model. Microvoid nucleation lead to ductile fracture in the sample, with some cases of dimpling occuring and in other cases microvoid coalescence causing cleavage. This is likely due to dislocation buildup which commonly occurs in AM materials.
