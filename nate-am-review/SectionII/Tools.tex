\subsection{Machine Learning Toolboxes}
All of the machine learning algorithms and approaches discussed in this review are, in some form, free and openly accessible. Many machine learning packages exist across many different programming languages and platforms. Commercially available platforms like MATLAB also have robust machine learning packages that can be installed. Table \ref{data_tools} highlights a variety of computational tools and packages and their relevance to AM synthesis optimization.
