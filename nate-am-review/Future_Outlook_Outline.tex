\title{Future Prospects for Data-Driven Methods in Materials Science \\ Outline}
\maketitle

\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Framing AM as a sub-field of materials science: other fields have tackled similar problems\begin{itemize}
		\item High-throughput studies have long been used in materials science \cite{Curtarolo}
		\item Multi-scale modeling has also been around in materials for a while \cite{ICME2013}
		\item Machine learning has been adopted in materials recently 
		\item \textbf{AM users do not need to reinvent the wheel (completely) when adopting data-driven methods for AM; they need to look to previous investigations in materials science}\end{itemize}
	
	\item Data driven/machine learning has been picking up in materials \begin{itemize}
		\item Promoted by materials genome initiative \cite{DePablo2014}
		\item Examples:Photovoltaic materials \cite{Olivares-Amaya}; Dialetric Materials \cite{Kim2016}; Molecule Design \cite{Butler2018}; \cite{Mannodi-Kanakkithodi2016} 
		\item Adoption of machine learning in AM should take into consideration how other fields are using it \textbf{so that standard applications of ML in materials science can be developed} 
		\item Review articles of ML for mat sci: \cite{Ramprasad2017, Kalidindi2016, Wagner2016, Jain2016}
		\item \textbf{The AM field, along with other fields of mat sci, should evolve toward standard practices in the use of machine learning}
		\item Maybe a good place to talk about standard data formats (e.g. the PIF)
		\item The `standard' adoption of ML (and what it would look like) is something that Branden, Brice, etc., may have insight on
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Moving AM toward a database-driven approach \begin{itemize}
		\item Other fields are already adopting databases: Mat Proj \cite{Jain2013}, AFLOW \cite{Curtarolo2012}; OQMD
		\item \textbf{Machine learning models can be improve with more data, therefore AM data should be widely \& publicly accessible}
		\item Discuss infrastructure necessary for use of AM databases
		\end{itemize}
