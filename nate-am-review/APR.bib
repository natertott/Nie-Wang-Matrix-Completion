The problem of solving the molecular Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation is mapped onto a non-linear statistical regression problem of reduced complexity. Regression models are trained on and compared to atomization energies computed with hybrid density-functional theory. Cross-validation over more than seven thousand small organic molecules yields a mean absolute error of {\~{}}10 kcal/mol. Applicability is demonstrated for the prediction of molecular atomization potential energy curves.},

Regression analysis unveils that the power factor is positively correlated with both the electronic band gap and the carrier effective mass, and that the probability of having large thermoelectric power factors increases with the increasing number of atoms per primitive cell. Avenues for further investigation are revealed by this work. These avenues include the role of experimental and theoretical databases in the development of novel materials.},

@article{Hautier2013,
	Abstract = {Finding new polyanionic Li-ion battery cathodes with higher capacities than LiFePO4 is currently a major target of battery research. One approach towards this goal is to develop materials capable of exchanging more than one lithium per transition metal. However, constraints on operating voltage due to organic electrolyte stability as well as cathode structural stability have made this target difficult to reach. More specifically, it is very challenging to develop a phosphate-based cathode in which a single element provides +2 to +4 redox activity in a reasonable voltage window: either the +2/+3 couple is too low (e.g., V) or the +3/+4 couple is too high in voltage (e.g., Fe). This makes several appealing structural frameworks such as tavorites difficult to use as practical two-electron systems. Here, we propose a voltage design strategy based on the mixing of different transition metals in crystal structures known to be able to accommodate lithium in insertion and delithiation. By mixing a metal active on the +2/+3 couple (e.g., Fe) with an element active on the +3/+5 or +3/+6 couples (e.g., V or Mo), we show that high capacity multi-electron cathodes can be designed in an adequate voltage window. We illustrate our mixing strategy on LiMP2O7 pyrophosphates as well as LiMPO4(OH) and LiM(PO4)F tavorites, and we use density functional theory computations to evaluate the theoretical capacity, voltage profile and stability of the compounds proposed by our design rules. From this analysis, we identify several new compounds of potential interest as cathode materials.},

Both techniques resulted in dense components with lamellar ??/?? microstructure. Large ultimate tensile strength values between 900 and 1000 MPa were observed. The strain at failure strongly depends on the orientation, where highest values up to 19{\%} were obtained in direction of the building direction. Heat treatment increased the highest strain at failure up to 22{\%}. The fatigue limit was observed to be higher than 770 MPa. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

One of the major challenges faced by additive manufacturing (AM) is the residual stresses generated during AM part fabrication often leading to unacceptable distortions and degradation of mechanical properties. Therefore, gaining insight into residual strain/stress distribution is essential for ensuring acceptable quality and performance of high-tech AM parts. This research is aimed at comparing microstructure and residual stress built-up in Ti-6Al-4V AM components produced by Wire. +.

	Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides unique opportunities for producing net-shape geometries at the macroscale through microscale processing. This level of control presents inherent trade-offs necessitating the establishment of quality controls aimed at minimizing undesirable properties, such as porosity and residual stresses. Here, we perform a parametric study into the effects of laser scanning pattern, power, speed, and build direction in powder bed fusion AM on residual stress. In an effort to better understand the factors influencing macroscale residual stresses, a destructive surface residual stress measurement technique (digital image correlation in conjunction with build plate removal and sectioning) has been coupled with a nondestructive volumetric evaluation method (i.e., neutron diffraction). Good agreement between the two measurement techniques is observed. Furthermore, a reduction in residual stress is obtained by decreasing scan island size, increasing island to wall rotation to 45 deg, and increasing applied energy per unit length (laser power/speed). Neutron diffraction measurements reveal that, while in-plane residual stresses are affected by scan island rotation, axial residual stresses are unchanged. We attribute this in-plane behavior to misalignment between the greatest thermal stresses (scan direction) and largest part dimension. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International (outside the USA).},

Despite the technological importance of this class of materials, for only a small fraction of all inorganic compounds which display compatible crystallographic symmetry, has piezoelectricity been characterized experimentally or computationally. In this work we employ first-principles calculations based on density functional perturbation theory to compute the piezoelectric tensors for nearly a thousand compounds, thereby increasing the available data for this property by more than an order of magnitude. The results are compared to select experimental data to establish the accuracy of the calculated properties. The details of the calculations are also presented, along with a description of the format of the database developed to make these computational results publicly available. In addition, the ways in which the database can be accessed and applied in materials development efforts are described.},

	Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has been researched and developed for more than 20 years. Rather than removing materials, AM processes make three-dimensional parts directly from CAD models by adding materials layer by layer, offering the beneficial ability to build parts with geometric and material complex- ities that could not be produced by subtractive manufactur- ing processes. Through intensive research over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in the development and commercialization of new and innova- tive AM processes, as well as numerous practical applications in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, energy and other fields. This paper reviews the main processes, materials and applications of the current AM technology and presents future research needs for this technology.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Additive manufacturing processes take the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) file that is later converted to a stereolithography (STL) file. In this process, the drawing made in the CAD software is approximated by triangles and sliced containing the information of each layer that is going to be printed. There is a discussion of the relevant additive manufacturing processes and their applications. The aerospace industry employs them because of the possibility of manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight. Additive manufacturing is transforming the practice of medicine and making work easier for architects. In 2004, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers did a classification of the various technologies and there are at least four additional significant technologies in 2012. Studies are reviewed which were about the strength of products made in additive manufacturing processes. However, there is still a lot of work and research to be accomplished before additive manufacturing technologies become standard in the manufacturing industry because not every commonly used manufacturing material can be handled. The accuracy needs improvement to eliminate the necessity of a finishing process. The continuous and increasing growth experienced since the early days and the successful results up to the present time allow for optimism that additive manufacturing has a significant place in the future of manufacturing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Arrays containing different combinations, stoichiometries, and deposition sequences of BaCO(3), Bi(2)O(3), CaO, CuO, PbO, SrCO(3), and Y(2)O(3) were generated with a series of binary masks. The arrays were sintered and BiSrCaCuO and YBaCuO superconducting films were identified. Samples as small as 200 micrometers by 200 micrometers in size were generated, corresponding to library densities of 10,000 sites per square inch. The ability to generate and screen combinatorial libraries of solid-state compounds, when coupled with theory and empirical observations, may significantly increase the rate at which novel electronic, magnetic, and optical materials are discovered and theoretical predictions tested.},

	Abstract = {Whereas structure-property relationships have long guided the discovery and optimization of novel materials, formal quantitative methods to identify such relationships in crystalline systems are beginning to emerge. Among them is cluster expansion, which has been successfully used to parametrize the configurational dependence of important scalar physical properties such as bandgaps, Curie temperatures, equation-of-state parameters and densities of states. However, cluster expansion is currently unable to handle anisotropic properties, a key distinguishing feature of crystalline systems central to the design of modern epitaxial structures and devices. Here, I introduce a tensorial cluster expansion enabling the prediction of fundamental tensor-valued material properties such as elasticity, piezoelectricity, dielectric constants, optoelectric coupling, anisotropic diffusion coefficients, surface energy and stress. As an application, I develop predictive ab initio models of anisotropic properties relevant to the design and optimization of III-V semiconductor epitaxial optoelectronic devices.},

	Abstract = {A new data-driven computational framework is developed to assist in the design and modeling of new material systems and structures. The proposed framework integrates three general steps: (1) design of experiments, where the input variables describing material geometry (microstructure), phase properties and external conditions are sampled; (2) efficient computational analyses of each design sample, leading to the creation of a material response database; and (3) machine learning applied to this database to obtain a new design or response model. In addition, the authors address the longstanding challenge of developing a data-driven approach applicable to problems that involve unacceptable computational expense when solved by standard analysis methods -- e.g. finite element analysis of representative volume elements involving plasticity and damage. In these cases the framework includes the recently developed ``self-consistent clustering analysis'' method in order to build large databases suitable for machine learning. The authors believe that this will open new avenues to finding innovative materials with new capabilities in an era of high-throughput computing (``big-data'').},

High-throughput DFT typically involves computations on hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of compounds, and such a change of scale requires new calculation and data management methodologies. In this article, we describe aspects of the necessary data infrastructure for such projects to handle data generation and data analysis in a scalable way.

@article{Shannon1948,
	Abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

Employment of a NN approach allows specification of multiple input criterion, and generation of multiple output recommendations. The inputs comprise the required mechanical properties for the PM material. The system employs this data within the NN in order to recommend suitable metal powder compositions and process settings. Comparison of predicted and experimental PM materials data has confirmed the accuracy of the NN approach, for predicting the materials and process settings needed for attainment of required process outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to systematically and critically review the literature related to process design and modeling of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and similar extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) or rapid prototyping processes. Design/methodology/approach -- A systematic review of the literature focusing on process design and mathematical process modeling was carried out. Findings -- FDM and similar processes are among the most widely used rapid prototyping processes with growing application in finished part manufacturing. Key elements of the typical processes, including the material feed mechanism, liquefier and print nozzle; the build surface and environment; and approaches to part finishing are described. Approaches to estimating the motor torque and power required to achieve a desired filament feed rate are presented. Models of required heat flux, shear on the melt and pressure drop in the liquefier are reviewed. On leaving the print nozzle, die swelling and bead cooling are considered. Approaches to modeling the spread of a deposited road of material and the bonding of polymer roads to one another are also reviewed. Originality/value -- To date, no other systematic review of process design and modeling research related to melt extrusion AM has been published. Understanding and improving process models will be key to improving system process controls, as well as enabling the development of advanced engineering material feedstocks for FDM processes.},

	Abstract = {There is consensus among both the research and industrial communities, and even the general public, that additive manufacturing (AM) processes capable of processing metal- lic materials are a set of game changing technologies that offer unique capabilities with tremendous application potential that cannot be matched by traditional manufacturing technologies. Unfortunately, with all what AM has to offer, the quality and repeatability of metal parts still hamper significantly their widespread as viable manufacturing proc- esses. This is particularly true in industrial sectors with stringent requirements on part quality such as the aerospace and healthcare sectors. One approach to overcome this challenge that has recently been receiving increasing attention is process monitoring and real-time process control to enhance part quality and repeatability. This has been addressed by numerous research efforts in the past decade and continues to be identified as a high priority research goal. In this review paper, we fill an important gap in the liter- ature represented by the absence of one single source that comprehensively describes what has been achieved and provides insight on what still needs to be achieved in the field of process monitoring and control for metal-based AM processes.},

We focus our discussion on the development of donor materials for organic photovoltaics by means of a cheminformatics approach. These methods enable the development of models based on molecular descriptors that can be correlated to the important characteristics of the materials. Particularly, we formulate empirical models, parametrized using a training set of donor polymers with available experimental data, for the important current--voltage and efficiency characteristics of candidate molecules. The descriptors are readily computed which allows us to rapidly assess key quantities related to the performance of organic photovoltaics for many candidate molecules. As part of the Harvard Clean Energy Project, we use this approach to quickly obtain an initial ranking of its molecular library with 2.6 million candidate compounds. Our method reveals molecular motifs of particular interest, such as the benzothiadiazole and thienopyrrole moieties, which are present in the most promising set of molecules.},

	Abstract = {The materials discovery process can be significantly expedited and simplified if we can learn effectively from available knowledge and data. In the present contribution, we show that efficient and accurate prediction of a diverse set of properties of material systems is possible by employing machine (or statistical) learning methods trained on quantum mechanical computations in combination with the notions of chemical similarity. Using a family of one-dimensional chain systems, we present a general formalism that allows us to discover decision rules that establish a mapping between easily accessible attributes of a system and its properties. It is shown that fingerprints based on either chemo-structural (compositional and configurational information) or the electronic charge density distribution can be used to make ultra-fast, yet accurate, property predictions. Harnessing such learning paradigms extends recent efforts to systematically explore and mine vast chemical spaces, and can significantly accelerate the discovery of new application-specific materials.},

	Abstract = {As mass production has migrated to developing countries, European and US companies are forced to rapidly switch towards low volume production of more innovative, customised and sustainable products with high added value. To compete in this turbulent environment, manufacturers have sought new fabrication techniques to provide the necessary tools to support the need for increased flexibility and enable economic low volume production. One such emerging technique is Additive Manufacturing (AM). AM is a method of manufacture which involves the joining of materials, usually layer-upon-layer, to create objects from 3D model data. The benefits of this methodology include new design freedom, removal of tooling requirements, and economic low volumes. AM consists of various technologies to process versatile materials, and for many years its dominant application has been the manufacture of prototypes, or Rapid Prototyping. However, the recent growth in applications for direct part manufacture, or Rapid Manufacturing, has resulted in much research effort focusing on development of new processes and materials. This study focuses on the implementation process of AM and is motivated by the lack of socio-technical studies in this area. It addresses the need for existing and potential future AM project managers to have an implementation framework to guide their efforts in adopting this new and potentially disruptive technology class to produce high value products and generate new business opportunities. Based on a review of prior works and through qualitative case study analysis, we construct and test a normative structural model of implementation factors related to AM technology, supply chain, organisation, operations and strategy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = { A methodical basis of the evolutionary method for selection and optimization of heterogeneous catalytic materials was developed. For validation, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was used as a model reaction. Various oxides (V2O5, MoO3, MnO2, Fe2O3, GaO, MgO, B2O3, La2O3) were chosen as primary components for the generation of catalytic materials. The first generation consisting of 56 catalytic materials was created by combination of the primary components in a stochastic manner. The materials of each preceding generation were selected based on the catalytic results obtained and subjected to an evolutionary procedure applying mutation and crossover operators to create further generations of catalytic materials of different qualitative and quantitative compositions. For illustration, four generations were created with a total number of tested catalytic materials of 224. As a result of the preliminary optimization procedure an increase in the propene yield was achieved with increasing number of generations; the results can be certainly improved by screening further generations of catalytic materials. Under standard conditions used for testing (T=500�C, C3H8/O2=3, p(C3H8)=30�Pa), the highest C3H6 yield amounted to 9.0{\%} (S=57.4{\%}) in the 3rd generation on V0.22Mg0.47Mo0.11Ga0.20Ox.},

Parameters such as the amount of porosity, pore size and pore shape are presented.

This classification accuracy is comparable to classification using conventional segmentation-based particle size analysis.

	Abstract = {We have developed an efficient and reliable methodology for crystal structure prediction, merging ab initio total-energy calculations and a specifically devised evolutionary algorithm. This method allows one to predict the most stable crystal structure and a number of low-energy metastable structures for a given compound at any P - T conditions without requiring any experimental input. Extremely high (nearly 100{\%}) success rate has been observed in a few tens of tests done so far, including ionic, covalent, metallic, and molecular structures with up to 40 atoms in the unit cell. We have been able to resolve some important problems in high-pressure crystallography and report a number of new high-pressurecrystal structures (stable phases: $\epsilon$ -oxygen, new phase of sulphur, new metastable phases of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, stable and metastable phases of Ca C O 3 ). Physical reasons for the success of this methodology are discussed.},

@article{Hart2005,
	Abstract = {Modern condensed-matter theory from first principles is highly successful when applied to materials of given structure-type or restricted unit-cell size. But this approach is limited where large cells or searches over millions of structure types become necessary. To treat these with first-principles accuracy, one 'coarse-grains' the many-particle Schrodinger equation into 'model hamiltonians' whose variables are configurational order parameters (atomic positions, spin and so on), connected by a few 'interaction parameters' obtained from a microscopic theory. But to construct a truly quantitative model hamiltonian, one must know just which types of interaction parameters to use, from possibly 10(6)-10(8) alternative selections. Here we show how genetic algorithms, mimicking biological evolution ('survival of the fittest'), can be used to distil reliable model hamiltonian parameters from a database of first-principles calculations. We demonstrate this for a classic dilemma in solid-state physics, structural inorganic chemistry and metallurgy: how to predict the stable crystal structure of a compound given only its composition. The selection of leading parameters based on a genetic algorithm is general and easily applied to construct any other type of complex model hamiltonian from direct quantum-mechanical results.},

@article{Poggio2004,
	Abstract = {Developing theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding intelligence. 'Learning from examples' is a paradigm in which systems (natural or artificial) learn a functional relationship from a training set of examples. Within this paradigm, a learning algorithm is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional solutions. A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning algorithm will generalize from its finite training set to novel examples. A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure generalization for the natural class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) learning algorithms that are based on minimizing the error on the training set. Here we provide conditions for generalization in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is perturbed by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change much. This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, subsumes the classical theory for ERM algorithms, and is applicable to more general algorithms. The surprising connection between stability and predictivity has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel algorithms, and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and engineering.},

Not only have we reproduced the known results for 10 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 132 , this approach has allowed us to extend the calculation for all N less than or equal to 200. This has allowed us to identify series of ''magic'' numbers, where the lowest-energy structures are particularly stable. Most of these structures are icosahedral, but we also find low-energy structures that deviate from icosahedral symmetry.},

Specifically, first-principles calculations of structure and properties are used to explore the microscopic origins of the functional properties of interest and to search a large space of equilibrium and metastable phases to identify promising candidate systems.

We propose a methodology that can accelerate this process by fitting data-driven models to experimental data as it is collected to suggest which experiment should be performed next. This methodology can guide the scientist to test the most promising candidates earlier, and can supplement scientific intuition and knowledge with data-driven insights. A key strength of the proposed framework is that it scales to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as are typical in materials discovery applications. Importantly, the data-driven models incorporate uncertainty analysis, so that new experiments are proposed based on a combination of exploring high-uncertainty candidates and exploiting high-performing regions of parameter space. Over four materials science test cases, our methodology led to the optimal candidate being found with three times fewer required measurements than random guessing on average.},

Two scenarios are relevant: (1) independent users generating databases in their own computational systems (off-line approach) and (2) teamed users sharing computational information based on a common ground (on-line approach). Both cases are integrated in the framework: for off-line approaches, the standardization is automatic and fully integrated for the 14 Bravais lattices, the primitive and conventional unit cells, and the coordinates of the high symmetry k-path in the Brillouin zones. For on-line tasks, the framework offers an expandable web interface, where the user can prepare and set up calculations following the proposed standard. Few examples of band structures are included.

	Abstract = {Lithium batteries have the highest energy density of all rechargeable batteries and are favoured in applications where low weight or small volume are desired --- for example, laptop computers, cellular telephones and electric vehicles1. One of the limitations of present commercial lithium batteries is the high cost of the LiCoO2 cathode material. Searches for a replacement material that, like LiCoO2, intercalates lithium ions reversibly have covered most of the known lithium/transition-metal oxides, but the number of possible mixtures of these2, 3, 4, 5 is almost limitless, making an empirical search labourious and expensive. Here we show that first-principles calculations can instead direct the search for possible cathode materials. Through such calculations we identify a large class of new candidate materials in which non-transition metals are substituted for transition metals. The replacement with non-transition metals is driven by the realization that oxygen, rather than transition-metal ions, function as the electron acceptor upon insertion of Li. For one such material, Li(Co,Al)O2, we predict and verify experimentally that aluminium substitution raises the cell voltage while decreasing both the density of the material and its cost.},

Visual bag of words, texture and shape statistics, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (deep learning algorithms) were used for feature extraction. Classification was then performed using support vector machine, voting, nearest neighbors, and random forest models. For each model, classification was completed using full (original size) and reduced feature vectors for each feature extraction method tested. Performance comparisons were done to evaluate all possible combinations of feature extraction, selection, and classifiers for the task of micrograph classification. Results demonstrate that pre-trained neural networks represent microstructure image data well, and when used for feature extraction yield the highest classification accuracies for the majority of classifier and feature selection methods tested. Thus, deep learning algorithms can successfully be applied to micrograph recognition tasks. Maximum classification accuracies of 91.85??????4.25{\%} and 97.37??????3.33{\%} for Tasks 1 and 2 respectively, were achieved. This work is a broad investigation of computer vision and machine learning methods that acts as a step towards applying these established methods to more sophisticated materials recognition or characterization tasks. The approach presented here could offer improvements over established stereological measurements by removing the requirement of expert knowledge (bias) for interpretation of image data prior to characterization.},

@article{Wang2017,
	Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3-D printing refers to a new class of technologies that actively construct products directly from any 3-D digital model. In the future, the broader applications of AM will require a cost reduction of AM machines. Currently, the products fabricated by low-end machines, such as those fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) processes, suffer from the issue of low dimensional accuracy due to multiple error sources. To properly manage error sources for improved prevision, this paper proposes a novel strategy for error compensation in the FDM processes. First, we consecutively attribute the dimensional inaccuracy to two major error sources that affect the geometric shape of the product: 1) positioning error of the extruder and 2) shape deformation induced by processing error, including material phase change and other variations that occur. The extruder positioning error is characterized by a Kriging model, while the modeling of shape deformation due to processing error follows the method developed by Huang et al. Second, using error equivalence concept, we transform the positioning error into the equivalent amount of design input error. Finally, we adjust the design to compensate for the overall shape deviation. To validate this strategy, we conduct a designed experiment for the shape deviation prediction and the compensation. The experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three-step strategy to manage multiple error sources in the FDM processes.},

However, the transition of this technology from production of prototypes to production of critical parts is hindered by a lack of confidence in the quality of the part. Confidence can be established via a fundamental understanding of the physics of the process. It is generally accepted that this understanding will be increasingly achieved through modeling and simulation. However, there are significant physics, computational, and materials challenges stemming from the broad range of length and time scales and temperature ranges associated with the process. In this paper, we review the current state of the art and describe the challenges that need to be met to achieve the desired fundamental understanding of the physics of the process.},

Machine learning approaches are effective in reducing the complexity of data and rapidly homing in on the underlying trend in multi-dimensional data. Here, we show that by employing an algorithm called the mean shift theory to a large amount of diffraction data in high-throughput experimentation, one can streamline the process of delineating the structural evolution across compositional variations mapped on combinatorial libraries with minimal computational cost. Data collected at a synchrotron beamline are analyzed on the fly, and by integrating experimental data with the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), we can substantially enhance the accuracy in classifying the structural phases across ternary phase spaces. We have used this approach to identify a novel magnetic phase with enhanced magnetic anisotropy which is a candidate for rare-earth free permanent magnet.},

	Abstract = {Simulation of temperature fields during selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing of AlSi10Mg powder was performed using the finite element method (FEM). The effects of laser power and scan speed on the SLM thermal behavior were investigated. It showed that the cooling rate of the molten pool elevated slightly from 2.13??106??C/s to 2.97??106??C/s as the laser power increased from 150W to 300W, but it enhanced significantly from 1.25??106??C/s to 6.17??106??C/s as the scan speed increased from 100mm/s to 400mm/s. The combination of a low laser power (200W) and a high scan speed (400mm/s) yielded a low temperature (1059??C) and an extremely short liquid lifetime (0.19ms), resulting in the poor wettability and occurrence of micropores in SLM-produced parts. The temperature gradient along the depth direction of the molten pool increased considerably from 10.6??C/??m to 21.7??C/??m as the laser power elevated from 150W to 300W, while it decreased slightly from 14.9??C/??m to 13.5??C/??m as the scan speed increased from 100mm/s to 400mm/s. The proper molten pool width (111.4??m) and depth (67.5??m) were obtained for a successful SLM process using the laser power of 250W and scan speed of 200mm/s. SLM of AlSi10Mg powder was also experimentally performed using different laser processing conditions and the microstructures of the SLM-fabricated samples were investigated to verify the reliability of the physical model. A sound metallurgical bonding between the neighboring fully dense layers was achieved at laser power of 250W and scan speed of 200mm/s, due to the larger molten pool depth (67.5??m) as relative to the layer thickness (50??m).},

	Abstract = {--- Predictive models for geometric shape deforma-tion constitute an important component in geometric fidelity control for three-dimensional (3D) printing. However, model building is made difficult by the wide variety of possible process conditions and shapes. A methodology that can make full use of data collected on different shapes and conditions, and reduce the haphazard aspect of traditional statistical model building techniques, is necessary in this context. We develop a new Bayesian procedure based on the effect equivalence and modular deformation features concepts that incorporates all available data for the systematic construction of predictive deformation models. Our method is applied to dramatically facilitate modeling of the multiple deformation profiles that exist in flat cylinders with different types of cavities. Ultimately, our Bayesian approach connects different process conditions and shapes to provide a unified framework for geometric fidelity control in 3D printing.},

However, to establish this production technology in industries with very high quality standards the accessibility of prevalent quality management methods to all steps of the process chain needs still to be enhanced. This publication describes which tools are and will be available to fulfil those requirements from the perspective of a laser machine manufacturer. Generally five aspects of the part building process are covered by separate Quality Management (QM) modules: the powder quality, the temperature management, the process gas atmosphere, the melt pool behaviour and the documentation module.

An in-house scanning x-ray microdiffractometer is used to obtain microXRD patterns from 273 different compositions on a single composition spread library. NMF is then used to identify the unique microXRD patterns present in the system and quantify the contribution of each of these basis patterns to each experimental diffraction pattern. As a baseline, the results of NMF are compared to the results obtained using principle component analysis. The basis patterns found using NMF are then compared to reference patterns from a database of known structural patterns in order to identify known structures. As an example system, we explore a region of the Fe-Ga-Pd ternary system. The use of NMF in this case reduces the arduous task of analyzing hundreds of microXRD patterns to the much smaller task of identifying only nine microXRD patterns.},

	Abstract = {Most tissue engineering (TE) strategies for creating functional replacement tissues or organs rely on the application of temporary three-dimensional scaffolds to guide the proliferation and spread of seeded cells in vitro and in vivo. The characteristics of TE scaffolds are major concerns in the quest to fabricate ideal scaffolds. This paper identifies essential structural characteristics and the pre-requisites for fabrication techniques that can yield scaffolds that are capable of directing healthy and homogeneous tissue development. Emphasis is given to solid freeform (SFF), also known as rapid prototyping, technologies which are fast becoming the techniques of choice for scaffold fabrication with the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional manual-based fabrication techniques. SFF-fabricated scaffolds have been found to be able to address most, if not all the macro- and micro-architectural requirements for TE applications. This paper reviews the application/potential application of state-of-the-art SFF fabrication techniques in creating TE scaffolds. The advantages and limitations of the SFF techniques are compared. Related research carried out worldwide by different institutions, including the authors' research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Silicon is the most important semiconducting material in the microelectronics industry. If current miniaturization trends continue, minimum device features will soon approach the size of atomic clusters. In this size regime, the structure and properties of materials often differ dramatically from those of the bulk. An enormous effort has been devoted to determining the structures of free silicon clusters1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Although progress has been made for Sin with n {\textless} 8, theoretical predictions for larger clusters are contradictory2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and none enjoy any compelling experimental support. Here we report geometries calculated for medium-sized silicon clusters using an unbiased global search with a genetic algorithm. Ion mobilities23 determined for these geometries by trajectory calculations are in excellent agreement with the values that we measure experimentally. The cluster geometries that we obtain do not correspond to fragments of the bulk. For n = 12--18 they are built on a structural motif consisting of a stack of Si9 tricapped trigonal prisms. For n 19, our calculations predict that near-spherical cage structures become the most stable. The transition to these more spherical geometries occurs in the measured mobilities for slightly larger clusters than in the calculations, possibly because of entropic effects.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the process monitoring and control in laser aided additive manufacturing (LAAM) were studied. Some key issues which affect the process monitoring and control were revealed and discussed in detail. The results show that the geometry of the parts affects the melt-pool temperature, especially where the heat dissipation is strongly limited. The power density distribution plays an important role for controlled LAAM process. The laser beam can only be defocused to a certain extent to avoid the insufficient power density due to the excessively enlarged beam size. This can cause defects on the clad surface and in the clad layer. Surface oxidation must be avoided during the process control, because surface oxidation can deteriorate the LAAM process, as indicated by the disturbances of the measured melt pool temperature. With the path-dependant process control, the dimensional accuracy of the deposition can be significantly improved. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Hernandez-Nava2015,
	Abstract = {Simple models describing the relationship between basic mechanical properties and the relative density of various types of porous metals (such as foams, sponges and lattice structures) are well established. Carefully evaluating these relationships experimentally is challenging, however, because of the stochastic structure of foams and the fact that it is difficult to systematically isolate density changes from variations in other factors, such as pore size and pore distribution. Here a new method for producing systematic sets of stochastic foams is employed based on electron beam melting (EBM) additive manufacturing (AM). To create idealised structures, structural blueprints were reverse-engineered by inverting X-ray computed tomographs of a randomly packed bed of glass beads. This three-dimensional structure was then modified by computer to create five foams of different relative density ??r, but otherwise consistent structure. Yield strength and Young's modulus have been evaluated in compression tests and compared to existing models for foams. A power of 3 rather than a squared dependence of stiffness on relative density is found, which agrees with a recent model derived for replicated foams. A similar power of 3 relation was found for yield strength. Further analysis of the strength of nominally fully dense rods of different diameters built by EBM AM suggest that surface defects mean that the minimum size of features that can be created by EBM with similar strengths to machined samples is ???1 mm.},
