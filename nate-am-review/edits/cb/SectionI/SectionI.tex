\section{Motivation}

Metals-based additive manufacturing (AM) represents a potential paradigm shift in how products are manufactured, providing versatility in the type and design of parts produced by a single manufacturing facility, decentralizing manufacturing capability, and enabling novelty in the properties and design of the parts, to name but a few benefits AM offers.
However, there have been significant roadblocks to fully realize AM's potential, particularly in the control of consistency and quality in part production and in the development of materials amenable to the AM process.
Although decades of immense scientific and engineering work, in industry, academia, and government, have produced large advances in making AM a practical manufacturing solution, \deleted[id=CB]{the} metallurgical challenges \deleted[id=CB]{facing AM} persist.
Computational materials simulation and the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) approach have made strides in accelerating materials development, but the features that make AM such a departure from traditional manufacturing requires more uniquely suited problem-solving methods.
In this paper, we argue that machine learning-based materials informatics is such a solution, capable of significantly accelerating the AM development process.

\added[id=CB]{What I took away here was that current methods (ICME) are not equipped to handle AM development. Is this just due to the size of the design space? Is ICME an optimizted DoX? Have AM processes been optimized through DoX?}

The 20th century saw the maturation of materials science and engineering as a field of study, enabling more rapid development of novel materials and materials manufacturing methods for specific applications.
The process-structure-properties-performance paradigm transformed the combinatorial trial-and-error and intuition-driven materials discovery process into a problem of engineering a desired microstructure through designed processing.
For instance, the history of turbine blade superalloy development is typified by advancements in control over microstructure through processing, including increasingly complex alloying recipes, multi-step heat treatments, and single-crystal casting.\added[id=CB]{Do these need citations?}

In the past decades, materials development has greatly accelerated to match the broader acceleration of general technology advancement.
Computational materials science has enabled the prediction of microstructure from processing and of properties from microstructure, reducing the need for costly and time consuming experimentation. \added[id=CB]{Is this specific to AM? There are some fields in which computational methods struggle.}
\replaced[id=CB, remark=already defined]{ICME}{The Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)} approach tightly integrates physics-based computational models into the industrial design process, allowing the desired performance requirements of a part to guide the design of a novel material.
Examples include low-RE Ni superalloys for higher turbine performance and lower cost and the Ferrium S53 alloy designed for corrosion-resistant landing gears.\added[id=CB]{Do these need citations?}
Both cases took materials development timelines from decades to under ten years, demonstrating the practical capability of designing new materials within an industrial product timeframe.
Generalizing this capability to more industries and further accelerating the process is the primary goal of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI).

\added[id=CB]{Is it worth mentioning that ML/stats-based methods are ideal for use in areas where physics-based model fail?}

Current AM capabilities are limited by materials-based problems which are uniquely difficult to solve with the above paradigm.
The AM process itself is complex relative to traditional casting methods, including rapid solidification, vaporization and ingestion of volatile elements, and a complex thermal history, all of which vary with part location and require advanced computational tools to \deleted[id=CB]{replaced} predict microstructure and properties.
However, the lower cost and time barrier to entry for performing AM has enabled the rapid accumulation of experimental data, enabling the Edisonian approach for finding optimized AM processing methods and parameters of existing alloys.
For AM, the ICME-based tools have been catching up, attempting to bootstrap legacy models to this data, with limited success. \added[id=CB]{Is it possible to be more specific here?}
As such, current AM materials development is largely combinatorial, as the processing of legacy alloys are optimized with extensive design of experiments and AM-specific alloys with higher performance are just now being effectively developed.

It is within this context we argue that machine learning (ML) can accelerate the application of additive manufacturing.
ML as a method for model development has shown wide application in the past years, in industries ranging from finance to social networking.
The use of ML in materials has been relatively limited for a variety of reasons, primarily the lack of \deleted[id=CB]{a} robust and large dataset\added[id=CB]{s} on which ML can operate.
The MGI identified this as a primary problem for accelerating materials development, and there has been significant progress recently in infrastructure development for materials databases suitable for informatics tools such as ML. \added[id=CB]{Could cite materials proj/citrination/other?}
The \replaced[id=CB]{lack of}{difficulty in producing} physics-based ICME models and the ability to rapidly and efficiently sample processing space in a combinatorial approach makes additive manufacturing an attractive use case for ML.
Machine learning as a framework can couple the legacy ICME tools with the experimental data to produce much more accurate AM process-structure-property models and to automate the iteration of designed experiments for model improvement and optimized materials.

In this paper, we present our arguments for the use of ML to resolve AM challenges.
We begin by detailing how ML could be applied to AM and the use cases we envision.
Then we discuss existing AM models and how they could be integrated into a ML framework.
Existing examples of ML as applied to materials and AM specifically are then reviewed.
We conclude with a prospective outlook on the potential of ML for AM.

\added[id=CB]{I guess someone could ask the question "why now?" if AM/ML have both been around for so long? My main takeaways here are that the AM design space is large and we are not able to reduce this space to ideal places to look b.c of the lack of physics based models and computationals methods.}
\added[id=CB]{Therefore, ML is well-suited for the task as the are too many free variables for a traditional DoX.}
\added[id=CB]{I might re-structure this into 1-The AM design space is large. 2-Right now, ICME is being applied to AM problems and there are the issues. 3-where computational tools fall short 4-ML vs. DoX.}

%A.	The Edisonian Approach: Brute Force Search, Historical MatSci Approach: Trial and error requires luck and a lot of resources, takes a lot of time and money
