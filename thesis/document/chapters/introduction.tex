\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{Continuity Statement:}
There are several outstanding problems in the characterization of rapidly solidified alloys -- particularly additively manufactured alloys -- that require modern characterization techniques to address. These problems include
\begin{itemize}
	\item The determination of stress and strain during solidification
	\item Measurements of temperature during solidification
	\item Quantification of residual stress in samples
	\item Resolving the dynamics of phase transformations during solidification
	\item Quantification of phases, both expected and unexpected, after solidification
	\item Observation of diffusional processes during solidification
	\item The mechanical behavior of unique geometries
	\item The impact of the printing process on mechanical properties
\end{itemize}
High energy X-ray diffraction stands as an important tool to address these problems.
