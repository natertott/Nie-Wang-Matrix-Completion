\subsection{Differences between point depositions and line welds}
Talk about the observed differences in results between the two deposition geometries. What does this indicate about differences in the processes? Why are they different? What implications does this have for the modeling/research of AM Ti-6Al-4V?

\subsection{CHESS samples}
A build wall of Ti-6Al-4V was manufactured by a Sciaky E-beam DED process. Multiple build layers were manufactured on top of one another to form a build wall of about \textbf{how many?} layers. The sample was characterized using HEXRD and TEM to discover differences in the microstructure from the top to the bottom of the wall.
