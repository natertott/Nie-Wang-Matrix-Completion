\chapter{Outline}
This is an outline of all the sections of my Ph.D thesis that I think should be present. It will also help me in organizing all of the work I've done in graduate school.
\\
Let's start with just a list dating back to the beginning
\begin{itemize}
	\item Review paper on machine learning in additive manufacturing
	\item {\color{red} This is a maybe to include} Matrix Completion with Dr. Wang
	\item {\color{red} This is a maybe to include} Lockheed Martin Ti-6Al-4V project 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Laboratory X-ray Diffraction characterization of $\beta$ phase
		\item Metallography
		\item Hardness testing of antler sample 
		\item Metallograpy and microscopy of Ti-6Al-4V build wall
		\end{itemize}
	\item In Situ High Energy X-ray Diffraction of Cold Metal Transfer Welded SS308L and Ti-6Al-4V 
	\item High Energy X-ray Diffraction Characterization of Additively Manufactured Ti-5553 Octet Truss Lattices 
\end{itemize}
