\section{Introduction}


\section{Experimental Parameters}
\subsection{Weld Lines}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specifics of the Fronius CMT welder
	\item Diffraction experiment specifics
	\item Figure of experimental setup
	\item Detectors, pixel sizes, acquisition rate, d-spacing coverage, azimuthal coverage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Build Wall}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specifics of the Sciaky manufacturing process
	\item Diffraciton experiment specifics
	\item Figure of experimental setup
	\item Detectors, pixel sizes, d-spacing coverage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Laser Powder Bed Fusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specifics of LPBF process (not entirely sure which printer was used?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Characterization Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
	\item TEM specifics
	\item EDS specifics
\end{itemize}

\section{Observed Phase Changes During Manufacturing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plots showing phase fractions (solid and liquid) for point deposit, line weld, second pass line weld
\end{itemize}

\section{Distribution of Phases, Strains, Broadening in Build Wall}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Show the refinement, obviously
	\item Associate distributions observed with the in situ data
	\item Conjecture about how the microstructure evolves over time
\end{itemize}

\section{LPBF -- Fastest Cooling Rate Condition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not totally sure how this fits in with the other investigations, other than the fact that we have microscopy of the lath size
\end{itemize}
